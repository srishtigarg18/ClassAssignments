      During sports we come to learn many things. We learn how to maintain mental balance in the midst of hopes and despair.
      They make us learn how to tackle the difficult situation. Sports develop a sense of friendliness.
      They develop in us team spirit. They help in developing mental and physical toughness.
      They shape our body and make it strong and active. They give us energy and strength.
      They remove tiredness and lethargy. They improve blood circulation. This improves our physical well-being.

Sports and games improve our capability. They improve our efficiency.
 Either study or work alone makes us exhaust. We remain no longer efficient to do any work.
 Sports remove our mental exhaustion. Sports are integral part of education. Education without sports is incomplete.
 Keeping their value in life, children are taught some sorts of games in the very early stage in school.
 These days' sports are a part of academic curricula.
