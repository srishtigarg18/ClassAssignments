    <p id="p1"><em>“Sports and games are means of mental and physical growth.
      During sports we come to learn many things. We learn how to maintain mental balance in the midst of hopes and despair.
      They make us learn how to tackle the difficult situation. Sports develop a sense of friendliness.
      They develop in us team spirit. They help in developing mental and physical toughness.
      They shape our body and make it strong and active. They give us energy and strength.
      They remove tiredness and lethargy. They improve blood circulation. This improves our physical well-being.
Sports and games improve our capability. They improve our efficiency.
 Either study or work alone makes us exhaust. We remain no longer efficient to do any work.
 Sports remove our mental exhaustion. Sports are integral part of education. Education without sports is incomplete.
 Keeping their value in life, children are taught some sorts of games in the very early stage in school.
 These days' sports are a part of academic curricula.”</em></p><br><br><br><br></div>

   This year’s team was the toughest team I’ve ever worked with and I credit that to the consistent work we did with Athlete Tough all season.
    They learned how to reset when things didn’t go as planned, they learned that taking full advantage of an uncomfortable situation makes
     them better, and they learned that they can endure much more work than they thought they could.
     The season was full of “tough” situations and they handled them all because of the tools they had from Athlete Tough.”</em></p>

          been revolutionary. Knowledge is key and we should never stop learning. Learning is how you become the best Coach you can be. Working with Bo
          and Liz has been a fantastic experience not only for me, but for the entire team. Our players have gained so much from learning about their
          own profiles and those of the rest of the team. After working with Athlete Assessments, it created a greater awareness that we all
          have different skills and all bring something to the team. It made practice drills so much easier because the team embraced the challenge of
          learning to work with others they might not normally. It helped shape the culture and environment on our team which is so important because
          Florida First is something we just don’t compromise on. With so many great players, our team goals must come first.”</em></p>

As I started to read it, I immediately searched to the end to contact the author, and found that it was Bo Hanson. We had been so close in three previous championship games and I knew this was the missing link. It was through Bo’s assistance that we found a way to get closer to team synergy. He helped us look deeply into the mirror and build honesty with one another. Ultimately, the trust we created was what provided immense value to the end result.”</em></p>
